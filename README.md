## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for accessibility.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling (No frameworks used).
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub.

## 🎨 Design System
I moved away from standard bootstrap templates to create a unique **"Vintage/Warm"** aesthetic.
* **Primary Color:** `#DCC3A1` (Warm Beige)
* **Accent Color:** `#2C241B` (Dark Coffee)
* **Typography:** Clean, readable sans-serif fonts.

## 📸 Note on Images
Currently, the profile picture is a **placeholder/muse** (Jungkook 📸) used for layout and aesthetic inspiration while I finalize my professional headshots. The layout is designed to work best with warm-toned photography.

## 🔜 Future Roadmap
* [ ] Integrate **Java Project** showcases (Backend logic).
* [ ] Add a working **Contact Form**.
* [ ] Make the design fully responsive for mobile devices.

# 🎨 Aishitha's Personal Portfolio (v0.1)

Welcome to my digital home! This is a personal portfolio website built from scratch to showcase my academic journey and projects as a Computer Science student at **Geethanjali Institute of Science & Technology**.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for accessibility.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling (No frameworks used).

## 🎨 Design System
I designed a custom layout with a **"Warm Vintage"** aesthetic to create a welcoming reading experience.
* **Primary Background:** `#dfc9a4` (Warm Sand)
* **Text Color:** `#1C1C1C` (Soft Black for high contrast)
* **Typography:** Clean, readable fonts.

## 📸 Note on Images
Currently, the profile picture is a **placeholder/muse** (Jungkook 📸) used for layout and aesthetic inspiration while I finalize my professional headshots.
